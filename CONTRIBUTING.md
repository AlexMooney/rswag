We put forward the philosophy put forward by the [react community](https://reactcommunity.org/) about ownership, responsibility and avoiding burnout.

We also strive to achieve [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for this repo.

## Fork, then clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:rswag/rswag.git
cd rswag
```

## Build
Set up your machine:
```
./ci/build.sh
```
Or manually
```
bundle
cd test-app
bundle exec rake db:setup
cd -

cd rswag-ui
npm install
cd -
```

### Troubleshooting:
- `libv8` or `therubyracer` MacOS Catalina/Big Sur install issues:
  ```
  An error occurred while installing libv8 (3.16.14.19), and Bundler cannot continue.
  Make sure that `gem install libv8 -v '3.16.14.19' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before bundling.

  An error occurred while installing therubyracer (0.12.3), and Bundler cannot continue.
  Make sure that `gem install therubyracer -v '0.12.3' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'` succeeds before bundling.
  ```

  Try, [reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62413041/7477016):
  ```
  brew install v8@3.15
  bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8
  bundle config build.therubyracer --with-v8-dir=$(brew --prefix v8@3.15)
  bundle
  ```

## Test
Initialize the rswag-ui repo with assets.
```
ci/build.sh
```

Make sure the tests pass:
```
./ci/test.sh
```
or manually
```
cd test-app
bundle exec rspec
```

## Updating Swagger UI

Find the latest versions of swagger-ui here:  
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases

Update the swagger-ui-dist version in the rswag-ui dependencies
```  
./rswag-ui/package.json
```

Navigate to the rswag-ui folder and run npm install to update the package-lock.json


## Release
(for maintainers)

Update the changelog.md, putting the new version number in and moving the Unreleased marker.

Merge the changes into master you wish to release.

Add and push a new git tag, annotated tags preferred:
```
git tag -s 2.0.6 -m 'v2.0.6'
```

Travis will detect the tag and release all gems with that tag version number.
